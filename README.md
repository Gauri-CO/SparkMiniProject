## General Info
This project is PySpark Mini Project that uses Data Frame to get the number of accidents per make and year of the car

## Description
In this project, we need to utilize data from an automobile tracking platform that tracks the history of important incidents after the initial sale of a new vehicle. Such incidents include subsequent private sales, repairs, and accident reports. The platform provides a good reference for second-hand buyers to understand the vehicles they are interested in.

A PySpark program needs to be developed to get the number of accident records per make and year of the car.

## Technologies
* PySpark 3
* Jupyter NoteBook



## Data.csv loaded into DataFrame


## Create two Dataframes (Accident records and Initial Records)


## Inner Join two dataframe to create Final Dataframe, group by Make and Year
